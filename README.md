# FlowGen — Visual Workflow Automation
## (Work in progress)

**FlowGen** is a visual workflow automation platform that lets you design, execute, and monitor automations using a drag-and-drop interface.  
It bridges triggers, actions, and data flow between services — turning complex backend automation into a visual experience.

## Features

- **Visual Workflow Builder** — Create automations by connecting triggers and actions in a React Flow-powered canvas.  
- **Dynamic Execution Engine** — Stepwise execution with real-time logging and error handling.  
- **Event-Driven Logic** — Automatically link outputs of one node to inputs of another.  
- **GraphQL API** — Unified data layer for workflows, triggers, and executions.  
- **Clerk Auth Integration** — Secure authentication and session management.  
- **Extensible Architecture** — Easily add new triggers or actions without changing the core engine.

## Core Concepts

### Triggers
Define when a workflow starts — Scheduled task.

### Actions
Tasks that execute after a trigger fires — send an email, call an API, update a database, or automate browser actions.

### Workflows
A chain of triggers and actions connected visually to represent logic flow and data movement.
